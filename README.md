# Ho karabiner scripts
These are my personal scripts for [Karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for macOS.
Complex scripts must be placed in `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/` folder.


#### lang_switch.json
Toggle layouts with: Left CMD (⌘) + Shift. This script toggle the layout between russian and english keyboard layouts. You need to install [typography-layout](https://ilyabirman.net/typography-layout/) before using. The scripts are using special id's only (see source code). Also see other methods of changing layout in \_old folder.

#### mouse_control_keyboard.json
Control mouse:
- pointer with right control (⌃) + arrow keys (hold left shift (⇧) to move faster)
- scroll with right control (⌃) + left option (⌥) + arrow keys.

* You need to enable [Mouse Keys](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/13.0/mac/13.0) for this.

#### parsec.json
Remap control button (⌃) to command (⌘) (only when Parsec app in the foreground).
